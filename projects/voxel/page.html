            This page is [Work In Progress], meanwhile please take a look at the preview video below. This system features a procedurally generated infinite terrain with kilometres of view distance, utilizing a LOD chain. Multiple "Dimensions" are supported, which are essentially different worlds loaded in at the same time, similar to how <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> handles the Nether and the Overworld.

            The current generation algorithm is pretty basic, but anything imaginable can be generated. A graph-based generator is in the works, which will allow for a user-friendly creation of terrain generators.

            <br>
            Terrain editing is done through the use of Stencils, which are serializable objects that can be passed through networking or saved to disk if needed, allowing on-demand terrain editing, which in turn allows for all terrain LOD levels to be edited (editing terrain kilometres away). Full multiplayer compatibility is planned.

            Currently 32 thousand types of materials are supported, with planned support for material meta-data. All voxel data is compressed with a custom compression algorithm to maximize efficiency, inspired by <a href="https://qoiformat.org/">QOI<a>.
